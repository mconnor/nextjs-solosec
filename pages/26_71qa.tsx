                    a='<p>
                        A patient only needs to take Solosec one time, orally, to complete treatment.1 Long-term use of Solosec should be avoided.

                    a='<p>
                        The entire contents of the Solosec packet should be sprinkled onto applesauce, yogurt, or pudding and consumed once within 30 minutes without chewing or crunching the granules.1 Instruct patients that they should not try to dissolve Solosec in water or any other liquids. However, they are free to drink a glass of water after taking their Solosec dose to aid in swallowing.

                            Solosec has no alcohol restriction; <i>in vitro</i> drug alcohol studies showed it does not interact with aldehyde dehydrogenase.1 There are no food restrictions, per the FDA-approved prescribing information, and Solosec has been tested not to interfere with combination ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone oral contraceptives.

                    a='<p>
                        Solosec is generally well-tolerated.1 The most common adverse reactions observed in clinical trials in over 2% of patients taking Solosec were vulvovaginal candidiasis, headache, nausea, dysgeusia, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and vulvovaginal pruritus.
